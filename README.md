# Password Generator

---

A password generator that creates a new, secure password based on a series of prompts. The prompts consist of length of the password (between 8 and 128 characters) & character types to include (uppercase, lowercase, numeric, and/or special characters). At least one character type must be selected. After the prompts the password is generated.
